#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project#

The purpose of this project is to collect rawdata and make a tidy dataset that can be used in later analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at [link text][1]

##Instructions##

 You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Additional Information ##

This project can be done by using the files Codebook.md and run_analysis.R in the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project reposetory.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps.
